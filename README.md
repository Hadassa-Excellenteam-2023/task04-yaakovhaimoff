## Description

The City Search Program is a command-line application that allows users to search for cities based on proximity 
and various distance norms.
The program reads city data from a file, provides interactive prompts
for the user to enter search parameters, and displays the search results.

I decided to use std::multimap in the City Search
Program for its ability to efficiently store and
retrieve city data based on both x and y coordinates, or the city name. 
It provides automatic sorting, allows for multiple key 
lookups, and handles duplicates effectively, enabling accurate
and fast proximity-based searches.
